        </div>
        <p class="text-basic mgb-20">
          Hangeul (or the Korean alphabet) refers to the Korean writing and sound system. Hangeul was created in 1443
          by King Sejong (1418-1450), the fourth King of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. Before the 15th century, Koreans
          did not have their own writing system to represent their spoken language and, therefore, borrowed Chinese
          characters to record their speech. However, as the Korean language is structurally and phonetically widely
          different from Chinese, it was difficult and inconvenient for Koreans to learn Chinese characters. It was also
          difficult to represent Korean speech and ideas with Chinese characters. For this reason, King Sejong invented
          the Korean alphabet, consisting of consonants and vowels, which were called Hunminjeongeum, meaning “the
          correct sounds to teach the people.” Hangeul is the new name for Hunminjeongeum.
          Hangeul is widely cited as an excellent writing and sound system that is logical, concise, and easy to learn.
          Each
          alphabet in Hangeul represents one sound; once you learn the sound value of each consonant and vowel, you
          can easily read and write Korean letters. King Sejong made a statement in his 1446 document: “A wise man
          can acquaint himself with Hangeul letters before the morning is over; even an ignorant man can learn them in
          the span of ten days.” Due to the simplicity and efficiency of Hangeul, both South and North Koreas maintain
          exceptionally high literacy rates. Koreans commemorate and celebrate the invention of Hangeul every year on
          October 9th. In 1997, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
          designated
          Hunminjeongeum Haerye (a book providing explanations and examples of Hunminjeongeum) as an international
          archive property.

            <p class="text-basic">The speech of our country is different from that
              of China, so it cannot be communicated by means
              of Chinese characters. For this reason, commoners
              who wish to express themselves cannot communicate
              their thoughts in writing. I sympathized with them
              and created twenty-eight new letters. I only hope
              that every person easily learns them and
              conveniently uses them every day.</p>
