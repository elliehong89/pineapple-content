    Korea has four seasons (<strong class="primary-green">봄</strong> spring, <strong class="primary-green">여름</strong>
    summer, <strong class="primary-green">가을</strong> fall, and <strong class="primary-green">겨울</strong> winter).
    Koreans often refer to
    the change of the weather as a good conversation starter as the weather changes frequently. <strong
      class="primary-green">한반도</strong>
    (The Korean peninsula) is located in the temperate climate region. In hot summer months, the weather
    condition changes close to the tropical climate. The temperature changes from the winter averaging -6~3°
    C (21°F~37°F) in January to the summer averaging 23~ 26°C (73°F~78°F ) in August. The typical time of
    Korean summer is from July to August and is characterized as humid and hot with a long rainy season in
    July. This rainy season is called <strong class="primary-green">장마</strong> (jangma). Winter in Korea is
    generally cold, relatively dry, and clear.

    In winter, many Koreans celebrate <strong class="primary-green">첫눈 오는 날</strong> (the day of the first snow)
    with their loved ones. Koreans think the first snow is good news and a true beginning of winter. On this day
    they call friends and loved ones for a friendly get-together after work. They usually go out and have
    dinner and share drinks to celebrate the nature’s gift.
