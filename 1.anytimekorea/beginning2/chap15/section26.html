    Everyday Korean meal
  </h4>

  <p class="text-basic mgb-40">
    typical everyday meal in Korea includes a bowl of steamed rice as a staple for the table, accompanied
    by a Korean-style soup. There are usually 2-3 side dishes (<strong class="primary-green">반찬</strong>) made from
    different seasonal cooked
    vegetables or seasoned dried seafood products, such as <strong class="primary-green">오징어채</strong> (dry squid) or
    <strong class="primary-green">김</strong> (roasted seaweed
    sheets). At the center, one main dish, such as <strong class="primary-green">찌개</strong> (a stew) or <strong
      class="primary-green">구이</strong> (a grilled meat), is presented for
    sharing around the table. Some of the popular main dishes are <strong class="primary-green">된장찌개</strong> (a soybean
    stew with different
    kinds of meats), <strong class="primary-green">불고기</strong> (sweetly marinated sliced beef), <strong
      class="primary-green">생선구이</strong> (pan fried fish), and <strong class="primary-green">갈비찜</strong> or
    <strong class="primary-green">갈비구이</strong> (steamed or grilled ribs with sweet soy sauce).

    <strong>Kimchi (김치)</strong>, the national dish of Korea
  </div>
  <p class="text-basic mgb-40">
    One can say that the single most important national dish that most Koreans eat everyday would be <strong
      class="primary-green">김치</strong>
    (Kimchi). Styles of <strong class="primary-green">김치</strong> vary widely from region to region, and the main
    ingredients for <strong class="primary-green">김치</strong> also including
    vegetables such as <strong class="primary-green">무</strong> (radish), <strong class="primary-green">배추</strong>
    (napa cabbage), <strong class="primary-green">총각무</strong> (small radish) or even <strong
      class="primary-green">파</strong> (scallion). The kinds of
    <strong class="primary-green">김치</strong> that Koreans eat differ seasonally. In the summer, they make <strong
      class="primary-green">열무김치</strong> (young radish water kimchi). In
    the winter they typically make <strong class="primary-green">동치미</strong> (radish water brine kimchi). However,
    for all seasons, <strong class="primary-green">배추김치</strong> (napa cabbage kimchi) is the most popular. <strong
      class="primary-green">배추김치</strong> (napa cabbage kimchi) is prepared in several steps.

    First, cut napa cabbages into 4 pieces and brine them for a while.
  </p>
  <p class="text-basic mgb-40">
    Rinse them in cold water and season the salted napa cabbages with <strong class="primary-green">마늘</strong>
    (garlic), <strong class="primary-green">고춧가루</strong> (hot pepper
    flakes), <strong class="primary-green">젓갈</strong> (fish sauce), <strong class="primary-green">무</strong>
    (radish), and <strong class="primary-green">생강</strong> (ginger) seasoning.
  </p>
  <p class="text-basic">
    Now just put the cabbage in a cool place and wait for a few days for the appropriate fermentation process to
    occur, and there is your <strong class="primary-green">김치</strong>!
