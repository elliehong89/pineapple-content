  <h4 class="title-section bg-light-blue mgb-10">Korean food made with 장 (jang)</h4>
  <p class="text-basic mgb-40">
    Many Koreans enjoy dishes based on <strong class="primary-green">장</strong> (jang). Two of the most popular kinds of
    <strong class="primary-green">장</strong> are <strong class="primary-green">된장</strong> (doenjang)
    and <strong class="primary-green">고추장</strong> (gochujang). Both <strong class="primary-green">된장</strong> and
    <strong class="primary-green">고추장</strong> are made from fermented soybean paste, which has
    been identified as “slow food” as opposed to the concept of “fast food.” Modern scientists find these
    <strong class="primary-green">장</strong> ingredients to be one of the healthiest food sources. Koreans
    frequently make <strong class="primary-green">된장</strong> stew with various
    vegetable ingredients such as zucchini, onions, green onions, garlic, and tofu often with a choice of
    seafood or beef. <strong class="primary-green">된장찌개</strong> (doenjang stew) is popular among many Koreans and
    can be consumed any
    time of the day. <strong class="primary-green">고추장</strong> is the main seasoning for <strong
      class="primary-green">떡볶이</strong>(tteokboggi), the sweet and spicy rice cake that
    has become a very popular snack for the nation.
