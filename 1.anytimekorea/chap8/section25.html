          Buying drinks and meals for others
        </h4>

        <p class="mgb-20 text-basic">
          Many Koreans prefer paying drinks and meals for others when they go out together as a group. It is the
          culture, particularly for the older generation, that the oldest person pays for the younger ones in the group.
          When the older person in the group offers paying drinks and meals, it is polite to refuse the proposal and
          offer to help pay yourself. If the older person insists several times, it is now understood that the older
          person
          is going to pay the bill for the whole group. Cultural practice of paying for the group also depends on the
          nature of
          the group meeting. If it is a meeting of coworkers or colleagues of equal relationship, they divide the
          bill equally. Friends of the same age often divide the bill equally too.
